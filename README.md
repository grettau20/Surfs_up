# Surfs_up

Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to gather information about temperatures in Hawaii during the months of June and December to help W. Avy decide when opening the surf shop and wether the business will be sustainable all year long.

Results

To analyze the Hawaii data, we use Python, Pandas and SQLAlchemy.

1. There's only a difference of 3 degree between the average temperature in June (74) and December (71).
2. The maximum temperature only drops by 2 degrees from June (85) to December (83).
3. The minimun temperature in June is 64 which might still be ok for some surfers/customers but in December
   the temperature drops to a minimum of 54 which might be a little cold for the average surfer.

Summary

After reviewing both June and December temperatures, we believe W. Avy can open his shop in either month. Although, the colder December days might limit his customers compare to June. The average and maximum temperatures in both months are very similar and favorable to the business.

In addition to the temperature data for the months of June and December, I would query precipipation data to compute and compare rainy days. And I would also query wind speed data since that might attract more surfers and therefore more customers for W. Avy's shop.
